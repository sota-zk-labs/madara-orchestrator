/// The Database trait is used to define the methods that a database
/// should implement to be used as a storage for the orchestrator. The
/// purpose of this trait is to allow developers to use any DB of their choice
/// as long as they implement the trait
///
/// The Database should support optimistic locking. For example, assume we've two threads
/// A and B and both read the same Job entry J at nearly the same time. If A updates J at
/// time T1 and then B updates J at time T2 (T2>T1), then B's update should fail because
/// it's version of J is outdated.
